# League of Legends Profiles

Profile viewer for Riot Games' League of Legends. Profile information served from Node/Express backend communicating with the official Riot API and served on frontend with React/Typescript.

Originally, many of the profile viewers and match history pages for League have were focused and simple, but now most of them have become filled with bloat. This project aims to return to that, mostly for my own purposes serving what I want in a focused view.
